# 2D Top Down RPG in Unity

This is for my own implementation of the [Make an RPG](https://github.com/oneManDev-io/Make-an-RPG-Game-in-Unity-2022) tutorial by [One Man Dev](https://github.com/oneManDev-io).

It will be updated to use the latest Unity version, the URP, and the modern Input System package as well as other changes to fit my own personal style.
